**Attributes as Operators**  
We present a new approach to modeling visual attributes and attribute-object composition. We treat objects as vectors and attributes as operators that modify the object vectors to appropriately compose them into a complex concept. Not only does our approach align conceptually with the linguistic role of attributes as modifiers, but it also generalizes to recognize unseen compositions of objects and attributes.
