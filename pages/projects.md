**Object-Agnostic Activity Recognition**  
*Fall 2016, Class Project*  
Current activity recognition datasets are heavily object-centric. In the process, cues about human pose, relative position of the agent and the object, and other activity specific features may be lost in favor of stronger object identity features. In this project, we investigate this object-activity correlation, and propose ideas to counter its negative effects

**Neural Models for Relation Extraction with Background Knowledge**  
*Indian Institute of Science, Jun 2015 â€“ Jul 2016*  
This project explored the hypothesis that background information (in the form of verb and entity similarities) acts as intelligent regularizers for the task of relation extraction. This was cast as a multi-task learning problem where along with predicting the relations, the background information was explicitly modeled for pairs of sentences.
