**Dynamic Inference Paths in ResNets**  
*IBM Research, Summer 2017*  
The success of very deep convolutional neural networks is limited by their high computational cost. In this project we learn to dynamically choose which blocks of a ResNet to execute during inference so as to best reduce total computation without degrading prediction accuracy. Built upon a ResNet-101 model, our method achieves a speedup of 20% on average, going as high as 36% for some images, while maintaining the same 76.4% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet.

**Neural Models for Relation Extraction with Background Knowledge**  
*Indian Institute of Science, Jun 2015 – Jul 2016*  
This project explored the hypothesis that background information (in the form of verb and entity similarities) acts as intelligent regularizers for the task of relation extraction. This was cast as a multi-task learning problem where along with predicting the relations, the background information was explicitly modeled for pairs of sentences.

**Computational Design of Antimicrobial Peptides**  
*Indian Institute of Science, Jun 2015 – Jul 2016*  
There is a pressing need for new therapeutics to combat multi-drug and carbapenem-resistant bacterial pathogens. We use an LSTM language model to understand the underlying grammar, i.e. the arrangement and frequencies of amino acid residues, in known antimicrobial peptide sequences. According to the output of our LSTM network, we synthesized 10 peptides and tested them against known bacterial pathogens. All of these peptides displayed broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, the two most effective ones displaying activity against multidrugresistant (MDR) strains.
