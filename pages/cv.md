# Research Experience

**Activity Recognition with Biased Datasets** | Jan 2017–  
*Research Assistant | Dr. Kristen Grauman | UT Austin*  
· Exploring strong dataset biases, and their effect on the generalization ability of models.  
· Exploring learning constraints to aid prediction of semantically related activities.

**Neural Models for Relation Extraction with Background Knowledge** | Jun 2015 – Jul 2016  
*Research Intern | Dr. Partha Talukdar | Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore*  
· Modeled neural network architectures with attention mechanisms for the task of relation extraction.  
· Explored the hypothesis that background information (in the form of verb and entity similarities) acts as intelligent regularizers during optimization.

**Distributed Machine Learning with Apache Spark** | Summer 2014  
*Research Intern | Dr. Sourangshu Bhattacharya | Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur*  
· Built a generalized quadratic optimizer in Java/Scala to optimize modified objective functions for support vector machines (SVM)  
· Deployed system on the Apache Spark framework and benchmarked against LibSVM.

**Computational Design of Antimicrobial Peptides** | Jun - Dec 2015  
*Collaboration with Dept. of Biochemistry | Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore*  
· Designed protein sequences that exhibit antimicrobial properties using residue level recurrent neural networks (in Torch)  
· Synthesized the designed peptide sequences and performed biochemical tests for antimicrobial activity.
