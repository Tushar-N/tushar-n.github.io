**Research Intern** - Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore | Dr. Partha Talukdar | Jun 2015 – Jul 2016


# Projects
---
**Dynamic Inference Paths in ResNets** | May - Aug 2017  
*Research Intern | Dr. Rogerio Feris | IBM Research, Yorktown Heights*  
· Trained an RL based agent to drop blocks of a ResNet conditioned on the input image  
· Achieves 20%-36% speedup with no loss of accuracy  
· Paper accepted to CVPR 2018 (Spotlight) [[link]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.08393.pdf)  

**Neural Models for Relation Extraction with Background Knowledge** | Jun 2015 – Jul 2016  
*Research Intern | Dr. Partha Talukdar | Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore*  
· Modeled neural network architectures with attention mechanisms for the task of relation extraction.  
· Explored the hypothesis that background information (in the form of verb and entity similarities) acts as intelligent regularizers during optimization.  
· Presented as a ACL 2017 Workshop paper [[link]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09942.pdf)

**Computational Design of Antimicrobial Peptides** | Jun - Dec 2015  
*Collaboration with Dept. of Biochemistry | Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore*  
· Designed protein sequences that exhibit antimicrobial properties using residue level recurrent neural networks (in Torch)  
· Synthesized the designed peptide sequences and performed biochemical tests for antimicrobial activity.  
· Published in JBC 2017 [[link]](http://www.jbc.org/content/early/2017/12/19/jbc.M117.805499.full.pdf)
