I am a 2nd year graduate student in the Department of Computer Science at UT Austin, working with [Dr. Kristen Grauman](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~grauman/). I am broadly interested in Computer Vision and NLP, and the intersection between the two fields. 

Before coming to UT, I was an intern at [MALL Lab](https://malllabiisc.github.io/), IISc, working with [Dr. Partha Talukdar](http://talukdar.net/) on Relation Extraction in the presence of Background Knowledge. I completed my B.E. in Computer Science from BITS Goa.
